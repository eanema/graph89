# Graph 89

Graph89 is an emulator targeting the Android platform for TI89, TI89T, TI92, TI92+, V200, TI84+, TI84+SE, TI83, TI83+ and TI83+SE calculators.

This is a continuation of the awesome work done by Dritan Hashorva to bring a bit of UI polish and modern feature enhancements to the project.
It was forked from the [last version distributed by the original author](https://bitbucket.org/dhashoandroid/graph89-paid/).

Kudos to him and everyone involved in the TI emulation projects, especially the TiEmu and TilEm developers.

I am no longer maintaining binary releases here. Please look for the latest binary release in the [F-Droid build](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.eanema.graph89/) repo

## This Fork

This is a fork from https://github.com/milaq/graph89 to add support for 64-bit android/x86 platforms. 
The important change for 64-bit support was to patch glib to use 64-bit integers for gsize & gssize. 
There was a bit of warning clean-up (there are still hundreds of warnings in the arm64-v8a build but the 
app appears to work). After that the ROM manager was updated to support Android SDK 34 and the scoped storage paradigm.
